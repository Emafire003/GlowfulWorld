# Glowful world
Well, the world these days is a bit black and white, isn't it? Why not make it glow a bit more?!

This mod helps you with that, it makes (almost) every entity have a unique color for the glowing effect, the one
from spectral arrows. (also, don't you have the feeling that shulkers should make you glow too for some reason?)

## Installation
Just drop it inside your mods/ folder along with ColoredGlowLib and Fabric API

Anyway, this is a simple mod, literally just has one class, made to provide an example of the ColoredGlowLib library.
